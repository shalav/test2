# Stock Dashboard

A simple static web app that displays information for NVDA and TSLA.

## Usage

Open `webapp/index.html` in your browser to view the dashboard. It contains
sample data with price charts, options chain tables, and links to sample news
for each ticker. No build step is required; simply open the file directly or
serve the `webapp` directory with a static file server.
